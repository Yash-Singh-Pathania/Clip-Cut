Would act as the persistent storage in docker for all services to have a common pool to access the videos  and other files from. 



1. fronted end basically uplaod where uploads it  ( allowed that quality of the video he wants to back in )
1. upload : 
    1. audio + video
    1. 
audio 
audio processing -> translate audio ()

transcription -> audio made ( in the language asked) output txt file transcript of the video ( written version ) ( python libraries )

video : 
quality conversion 


streaming that will send this back to the user ( i dont think he can just download it )


swagger -> for documentation of api
db -> that will be persistent across services that will monitor ( the status would uploaded -> splitting -> audio generated - > video generated -> finsihed )

streaming : 
websockets : to tell the front end that for this user and this video the process is done , the clicks on the notification and then what he can download vidoes 

which service you make ,. it will will curls i think most probably queue  

a grade
