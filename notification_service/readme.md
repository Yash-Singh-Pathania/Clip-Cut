## WebSocket Notification Service

This service integrates WebSocket technology to enhance user interaction by providing real-time updates about video processing status. Below are the specific functionalities and behaviors expected from this service:

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this service is to monitor the `video_status` table in the PostgreSQL database, ensuring users are promptly informed when their videos are fully processed and ready for viewing.

### Functionality
- **Monitor Video Status:**
  - Continuously check the `video_status` table to determine the processing state of a video.
  - Identify when the video reaches the "processed and ready for viewing" state, which signifies the completion of all processing steps.

- **User Notification:**
  - Utilize WebSockets to send real-time notifications to users indicating that their video is ready to be viewed.
  - Include a direct link to the newly processed video in the notification, allowing users to view the video with a single click.

### Implementation Notes
- Ensure that the WebSocket connection remains stable and efficient to handle real-time data without causing delays or excessive server load.
- Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues in video processing or data transmission smoothly.

By adhering to these specifications, the WebSocket Notification Service will significantly enhance user experience by providing timely and interactive feedback directly related to their content.
